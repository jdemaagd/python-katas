# Algorithm Design

## Techniques

- Recursion
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
    - Characteristics
        - Optimal substructure
        - Overlapping sub-problem
    - Techniques
        - Top-down with memoization
        - Bottom-up approach
    - NOTE: keep track of previously solved sub-problems as not to recompute any previously encountered sub-problems
      (unlike in recursion)
- Greedy Algorithms
    - Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree
    - Dijkstra’s shortest path problem
    - The Knapsack problem
    - Prim’s minimal spanning tree algorithm
    - The traveling salesperson problem
