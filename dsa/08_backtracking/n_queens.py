"""
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
You may return the answer in any order.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example 1
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

Example 2
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]

Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 9

Observations:
0. filling row by row
1. only one queen per row
2. check col up to current row (cols above row)
3. check top-left diagonal
4. check top-right diagonal

#     row 3 -> n - 4
#     upper bound can be taken as n!
#     notice that it's not n^n because of pruning
#     we're not filling queens in all the positions in all the rows
#     whenever we encounter a scenario that is not valid, we prune that branch
# Space Complexity Analysis -> ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)
#     as we build solutions we have to hold state of board (n x n)
#     we know that every row will have only 1 queen
#     so recursive call stack will take the order of n
#     we take the dominant term which is n^2 over n
# NOTE: space used just to return output is not counted as auxiliary space and not counted in space complexity
