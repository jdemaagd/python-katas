## Operations

- Access: Space & Time Complexity --> O(1)
- Set: Space & Time Complexity --> O(1)
- Traverse/Search: Space --> O(1), Time Complexity --> O(n)
- Copy: Space & Time Complexity --> O(n)
- Insert: Space Complexity --> O(1)
    - at beginning: Time Complexity --> O(n)
    - at end: Time Complexity --> Dynamic --> O(1), Static --> O(n)
    - somewhere in between: Time Complexity --> O(n)
- Remove: Space Complexity --> O(1)
    - at beginning: Time Complexity --> O(n)
    - at end: Time Complexity --> O(1)
    - somewhere in between: Time Complexity --> O(n)
