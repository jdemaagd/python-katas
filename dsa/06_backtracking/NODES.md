# Nodes

## Node Depth

- 3^0 = 1
- 3^1 = 3
- 3^2 = 9
- nodes = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^(n - 1), where n is depth/level of tree
- S<subscript>n</subsript> = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)
- Sum up to `n` terms, where `a` is first term, `r` is the base, and `n` is the number of terms
- Max # of nodes -> upper bound = N ^ (height + 1)
