# QUIZ: Dynamic Programming

## Question 1

```
What is the fundamental principle behind Dynamic Programming (DP)?

a. Dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem just once, 
   and storing their solutions.
b. Solving the problem using a greedy approach to find a global optimum.
c. Using backtracking to explore all possible combinations and solutions.
d. Decreasing the complexity of a problem by increasing the space complexity.

Solution: a
```

## Question 2

```
In Dynamic Programming, what is memoization?

a. A technique to remember and reuse solutions to sub-problems that have already been solved.
b. A method to forget unnecessary computations to save on processing time.
c. A strategy to divide the problem into smaller, manageable chunks.
d. A recursive technique without storing solutions.

Solution: a
```

## Question 3

```
Which statement is true regarding the bottom-up approach in Dynamic Programming?

a. It starts by solving the largest sub-problem first, 
   then works its way down to the smaller sub-problems.
b. It begins with the smallest sub-problems, 
   solving them and gradually building up to the solution of the entire problem.
c. It requires recursive calls to solve the sub-problems.
d. It is a purely theoretical approach and cannot be implemented in practical applications.

Solution: b
```

## Question 4

```
What is the importance of the "overlapping subproblems" property in dynamic programming?

a. It indicates that the algorithm will require exponential time to solve.
b. It means the problem cannot be solved using dynamic programming techniques.
c. It signifies that the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times, 
   making a case for memoization or tabulation to optimize the solution.
d. It suggests that each subproblem is independent and therefore must be solved from scratch.

Solution: c
```

## Question 5

```
Dynamic programming can be implemented using which of the following techniques?

a. Memoization
b. Tabulation
c. Both Memoization and Tabulation
d. Neither Memoization nor Tabulation

Solution: c
```
