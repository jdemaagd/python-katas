# QUIZ: Josephus Problem, Approach 1

## Question 1

```
Consider this revised version of the Python function intended to determine the winner in a game 
where players are eliminated in a cycle after every kth position:
    def findTheWinner(n, k):
        arr = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
        def helper(arr, start_index):
            if len(arr) == 1:
                return arr[0]
            index_to_remove = (start_index + k) % len(arr)  
            del arr[index_to_remove]
            return helper(arr, index_to_remove)
        return helper(arr, 0)
An error has been introduced in this version of the function. What is the error?

a. Using del arr[index_to_remove] to remove players can lead to inefficiency in memory usage 
   due to repeated list resizing.
b. The recursive call helper(arr, index_to_remove) incorrectly assumes 
   that the start index doesn't change after an element is deleted.
c. The calculation of index_to_remove is incorrect because it uses (start_index + k) instead of 
   (start_index + k - 1), skipping the proper player to be eliminated. 
d. The base case if len(arr) == 1: return arr[0] should return the index of the remaining player, 
   not the player's number.

Solution: c
```

## Question 2

```
Consider this and find the error
    def findTheWinner(n, k):
        arr = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
        def helper(arr, start_index):
            if len(arr) == 1:
                return arr[0]
            index_to_remove = (start_index + k - 1) % (len(arr) + 1)
            del arr[index_to_remove]
            return helper(arr, index_to_remove)
        return helper(arr, 0)
        
a. Deleting an element does not require recalculating the start index in this scenario.
b. Using del arr[index_to_remove] is inefficient and could be replaced with a more efficient method.
c. The modulo operation (len(arr) + 1) is incorrect because it may lead to an index_to_remove 
   that is out of bounds for arr.
d. The recursive call does not adjust the start index for deletions, 
   potentially causing incorrect elimination order.

Solution: c
```

## Question 3

```
Here's a modified version of the function with an intentional logical error:
    def findTheWinner(n, k):
        arr = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
        def helper(arr, start_index):
            if len(arr) == 1:
                return arr[0]
            index_to_remove = (start_index + k - 1) % len(arr)
            del arr[index_to_remove]
            next_start_index = (index_to_remove) % len(arr)
            return helper(arr, next_start_index)
        return helper(arr, 0)
        
a. The computation of next_start_index using just (index_to_remove) as is post-deletion 
   leads to a potential error in the next round's start position.
b. The deletion of the element at index_to_remove is handled correctly, 
   and thus the calculation of next_start_index needs no further adjustment.
c. Using modulo with len(arr) in the calculation of next_start_index is redundant 
   since index_to_remove is already within the array bounds.
d. The recursive function should not use the current index for setting the next start index 
   without considering the deletion effect on the array size.

Solution: a
```
