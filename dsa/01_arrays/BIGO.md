# Intro

## Data Structures

- Collection of data values
- The relationships among them
- The functions or operations that can be applied to the data

## Time Complexity

- Based on count of simple operations a computer has to do
- NOT based on time as two machines with different environments and hardware capabilities will have
  different times for the same algorithm
- Asymptotic Analysis: as n `grows`, in what proportion does the count of operations grow?

## Big O

- O(1): Constant
- O(log n): Binary Search
- O(n): Traverse an array
- O(n log n): Merge Sort
- O(n^2): All possible pairs of an array
- O(2^n): Fibonacci
- O(n!): Factorial

## Logarithms

- base 2 is default if not specified
- log <sub>2</sub>16 = 4 --> 2^4 = 16
- log 8 = 3 --> 2^3 = 8
