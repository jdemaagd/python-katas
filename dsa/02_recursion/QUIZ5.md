# QUIZ: Recursion

## Question 1

```
What is recursion in computer programming?

a. A function that calls itself within its definition.
b. A loop that executes a set number of times.
c. A method for solving problems by reducing them to smaller instances of the same problem.
d. Both a and c.

Solution: d
```

## Question 2

```
What is a base case in recursion?

a. The condition under which a recursive function stops calling itself.
b. The initial value provided to the recursive function.
c. The maximum number of times a function can call itself.
d. A special case that does not necessarily end the recursion.

Solution: a
```

## Question 3

```
In the context of recursion, what is stack overflow?

a. When the function calls itself too many times, exceeding the call stack limit.
b. When the memory allocated for the stack is completely used up by other programs.
c. A popular website where programmers ask questions about recursion.
d. When an array used in a recursive call exceeds its predefined size.

Solution: a
```

## Question 4

```
Consider a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number 'n'. 
Which of the following represents a correct base case for this function?

a. if (n == 1) then return 1
b. if (n > 1) then return n * factorial(n - 1)
c. if (n == 0) return 1
d. Both a and c are correct base cases.

Solution: d
```

## Question 5

```
What is an essential characteristic of a recursive function?

a. It must use global variables to keep track of its state.
b. It must always result in a faster execution time compared to iterative solutions.
c. It must include a condition that leads to the function calling itself.
d. It must have at least two base cases to avoid infinite recursion.

Solution: c
```
