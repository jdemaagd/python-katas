# QUIZ: Arrays

## Question 1

```

b. The runtime of the algorithm increases linearly with the increase in input size.
c. The runtime of the algorithm remains constant, regardless of the input size.
d. The runtime of the algorithm increases exponentially with the increase in input size.

Solution: b
