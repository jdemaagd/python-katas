# QUIZ: BackTracking

## Question 1

```
What is backtracking in computer science?

a. A data recovery technique to restore lost information.
b. An algorithmic technique for solving problems by trying to build a solution incrementally, one 
   piece at a time, and making changes to the state of the problem in place. It involves removing 
   those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time, 
   differentiating it from pruned recursion by the way it reverts state changes when backtracking.
c. A memory management technique that stores previous states of the program for future reference.
d. A debugging technique where the programmer retraces their steps to find bugs.

Solution: b
```

## Question 2

```
What is a key feature of the backtracking algorithm?

a. It uses a greedy method to find the solution without any back steps.
b. It involves dividing the problem into smaller subproblems and then combining the solutions of the 
   subproblems.
c. It systematically searches for a solution to a problem among all available options by building 
   candidates and abandoning those that are clearly not viable (pruning).
d. It improves the performance of algorithms by caching the results of expensive function calls.

Solution: b
```

## Question 3

```
In the context of backtracking, what does "pruning" refer to?

a. Cutting down the search space by removing options that are clearly incorrect or not promising.
b. Reducing the memory usage of the algorithm by deleting references to unnecessary objects.
c. Optimizing recursive calls to prevent stack overflow errors.
d. Trimming data inputs to manageable sizes before processing them.

Solution: a
```

## Question 4

```
What is the primary reason for using backtracking in algorithmic problem solving?

a. To ensure that the algorithm always runs in polynomial time.
b. To avoid unnecessary computations by "backtracking" when a potential solution path is determined 
   to be incorrect.
c. To increase the complexity of the algorithm to make it more secure against hacking attempts.
d. To use all available computational resources to guarantee the finding of a solution, regardless 
   of time constraints.

Solution: b
```

## Question 5

```
In a backtracking algorithm, how is the feasibility of a partial solution typically determined?

a. By comparing it against a set of predefined solutions.
b. Through user input at each step of the algorithm.
c. By applying a set of constraints to the partial solution to check if it could potentially lead to 
   a complete solution.
d. By calculating the total runtime of the algorithm with the partial solution and estimating its 
   efficiency.

Solution: c
